This will also serve as a playground for working upon different proof-of-concepts.

## Common Features

- Initial project structure
- Based on Typescript language
- Different patterns like Strategy, etc.
- Simple environment configuration
- Global environment object
- Request/Response encryption & decryption implementation
- Easily add new feature
- Unit & Integration test cases

## Running Development Mode

- Install the dependencies `npm install`
- Start the application `npm start`

## Running Production Mode

- Install the dependencies `npm install`
- Create the build `npm run build`
- Start the application `npm run start:production`
